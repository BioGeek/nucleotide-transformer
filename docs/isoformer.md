# Isoformer

Isoformer is a model able to accurately predict differential transcript expression, outperforming existing methods and leveraging the use of multiple modalities. 
Our framework achieves efficient transfer knowledge from three pre-trained encoders: Enformer for the DNA modality, Nucleotide Transformer v2 for 
the RNA modality and ESM2 for the protein modality.

# Training data

Isoformer is trained on RNA transcript expression data obtained from the GTex portal, 
namely Transcript TPMs measurements across 30 tissues which come from more than 5000 individuals. 
In total, the dataset is made of âˆ¼170k unique transcripts, of which 90k are protein-coding and correspond to âˆ¼20k unique genes.

## How to use ðŸš€

We make Isoformer available on HuggingFace and provide an example on how to use it at `./notebooks/isoformer/inference.ipynb`.
